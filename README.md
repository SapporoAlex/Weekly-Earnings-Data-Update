## Project Overview

The script in this repository was created to address the need for timely and accurate weekly earnings reports for Kyoto Machiyas. Manually compiling these reports was time-consuming and prone to errors. By automating the process, the company was able to streamline operations and ensure consistency in its reporting.

## How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Login to Databases**: Automatically logs into the Zeniyacho and Fukune databases using provided credentials.
2. **Data Extraction**: Extracts sales data for the current period and the next period from both databases.
3. **Data Processing**: Processes the extracted data to calculate total earnings and perform various analyses.
4. **Report Generation**: Generates an Excel report that includes:
    - Total earnings for the current and next periods.
    - Comparison with the previous weekâ€™s earnings.
    - Highlighted changes in earnings.
5. **Report Storage**: Saves the generated report in the designated directory (`earnings_report_kyoto_machiyas`).

## Benefits to the Company

The automation of the earnings report generation brought several key benefits to the company:

1. **Time Savings**: Reduced the time required to compile weekly earnings reports from several hours to just a few minutes.
2. **Increased Accuracy**: Minimized human errors in data extraction and calculation, ensuring more reliable reports.
3. **Consistency**: Provided a standardized format for earnings reports, making it easier to track performance over time.
4. **Scalability**: Enabled the company to handle an increasing volume of data without a corresponding increase in workload.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the script has greatly improved the reporting process, there are several areas for future enhancements:

1. **Data Visualization**: Incorporate charts and graphs into the Excel report for better data visualization.
2. **Email Notifications**: Automatically send the generated reports via email to designated stakeholders.
3. **Real-time Reporting**: Develop real-time reporting capabilities to provide up-to-the-minute sales data.
